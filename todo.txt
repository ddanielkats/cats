1. classify node per worker

2. later, build path for every workers
    each worker needs to have maximum stops
        if worker reaches limit, all nodes need to remove him from their lists


//alogorithm for nodes and paths works by shortest path first with weights per each data


to do

make the getTravelDAta merge the parsed_response and not the response itself
